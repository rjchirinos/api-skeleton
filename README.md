# API Skeleton
Backend skeleton for webapps using Node.js, Express and MongoDB

This skeleton encapsules rudimentary features and workflows repeated in most MERN applications, such as CRUD operations and authentication/authorization capabilities

## Features Breakdown
- Sign	up:	Users	can	register	by	creating	a	new	account	using	an	email address
- User	list:	Any	visitor	can	see	the	list	of	all	registered	users
- Authentication:	Registered	users	can	sign	in	and	sign	out
- Protected	user	profile:	Only	registered	users	can	view	individual	user details	after	signing	in
- Authorized	user	edit	and	delete:	Only	a	registered	and	authenticated	user can	edit	or	remove	their	own	user	account	details

The	aim	is	to	keep	the	skeleton	as	simple	as possible	so	it	is	easy	to	extend,	and	can	be	used	as	a	base	application	for developing	different	MERN	applications.
